As far as we can tell, everything seems to be working. We didn't encounter any major 
problems or surprises. There were several issues that we had to fix from the Semantics 
phase of the project, but those were mostly edge cases that we forgot to check for. 
We also had to change the Parser slightly because the associativity of the +/-/* 
operators was wrong.

We also changed the boot.c file found in src/runtime slightly to work with arrays bounds
checking.
