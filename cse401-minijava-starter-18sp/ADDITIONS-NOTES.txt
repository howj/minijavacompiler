Changes to previous parts of our project:

	Parser & Scanner:
		Made changes to our JFLEX and CUP files to add the new stuff pertaining to the new double type.
			CUP
				- Type ::= "double" new production
				- "double" is a new reserved word
				- expr ::= <DOUBLE_LITERAL> new production
			JFLEX
				- Added necessary regex for doubleliteral
				- added keyword for double
	
	Semantics:
		Created DoubleLiteral and DoubleType AST nodes.
		Changed Plus, Times, Minus so that instead of returning just "int" in getType, they return e1.getType().
		SemanticsCheckVisitor.java
			Changes to possibleTypes: added double
			Changes to checkVarType: added double
			Overloaded SameType with two new implementations.
				1: Compare e1 type to e2.
				2: Compare whether e1's type is equal to s1 OR s2
			Print: OK to print doubles
			LessThan, Plus, Times, Minus: added double support
	
	Visitors:
		All visitors needed to be updated with the new DoubleLiteral and DoubleType visit methods.
		
	OurSamplePrograms:
		Added additions folder
			SimpleDoubleTest and SDT2: tests for everything up to and including semantics for doubles.
	
	boot.c:
		Added a method for printing doubles
		
	Code Gen Visitor: 
	     	 Added checks for type everywhere that it is possible to have an int or a double. In the case of a double, 
		 adapted code to use floating point registers/ instructions
